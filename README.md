# ShopIt
Basic Shopping App (Uses Sqlite to store products)
This a very basic android shopping app. Requires Camera and location permissions.

How to use:
1. Run on Android Studio
2. Go to Build->Build APK to create APK to use.(otherwise run on emulator or use USB on your phone )
3. On the App, you will be seeing a blank screen.(You need to Add products as an admin)
4. For this, Signup as admin, keep "admin" as username and set a password.
5. Now login with this account to add products. These products will now be visible on the home page of your app.
6. For buying you need to signup and login using some other credentials.
7. You can search for products using the name of the products.



NOTE: This project is not completed and uses Sqlite for storing products and user information(client side database). So data is stored within the phone and not on a serverside database.
